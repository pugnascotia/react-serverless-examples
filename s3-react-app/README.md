# S3 + create-react-app - Serverless example

This example borrows very heavily from the Serverless
[aws-node-single-page-app-via-cloudfront](https://github.com/serverless/examples/tree/master/aws-node-single-page-app-via-cloudfront)
example. See that project for full details of how this works.

## Usage

```
yarn
```

(Seriously, use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) if you can instead of `npm`).
